# HOTâ€™s Infrastructure Modernization: Kubernetes

> [!Note]
> Currently under initial development. 

Kubernetes @ Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT).

See the [inital proposal](about/proposal.md) for more background.

## Getting Started

#### Required Tools

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)


### Areas for Further (Initial) Development

#### Variable Management

- Duplication exists between TF inputs, CI workflows, and local scripts.
- A tool like https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile may help with sourcing variables by environment.
    - A basic version has been added to deploy revision deltas, further templating would be required.
- As more HOT applications + services are moved to cluster, this will only grow.

#### Deployment

- Provisioning is currently done in the same workflow (TF, K8s, Helm), mostly as byproduct of initial development phase. Can be further refined.
- GitOps tools like ArgoCD are [in the works](https://github.com/hotosm/k8s-infra/pull/31)
- Flux [Tofu controller](https://github.com/flux-iac/tofu-controller) may be an analog for base infrastructure (further investigation required).

#### Bridging TF and Kubernetes

- TF-managed information often needs to be referenced on the cluster
    - ex: PostgresCluster CRD requires the role ARN authorized for backups. Role and bucket are created in TF.
- Global cluster resources are provisioned through TF, but argument can be made for their management by K8s. 
- Ideal solution enables cluster resources to reference, mount, inject, etc. TF-managed information with minimal developer intervention.
